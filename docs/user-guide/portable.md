# Portable mode

You can start Pegasus in portable mode by either

- launching it with the `--portable` command line option, or
- creating a file called `portable.txt` and placing it next to the Pegasus executable

In this mode, Pegasus attempts to write only into the directory it is placed in, making it easier to move your setup around.

**On Linux** note that by default the system might not allow running programs from USB drives or from NTFS file systems.
