# Installing themes

Themes are stored in the theme directory. The default location of that is:

- `~/.config/pegasus-frontend/themes/` (Linux)
- `C:/Users/[username]/AppData/Local/pegasus-frontend/themes/` (Windows)
- `~/Library/Preferences/pegasus-frontend/themes/` (macOS)
- `<storage>/pegasus-frontend/themes/` (Android)
- `<directory of the program>/config/themes/` (all platform)

If the directory does not exists, you can create it manually. Then simply extract the theme files to this directory and choose the theme in the Settings menu of Pegasus.

    If you wish to place the themes somewhere else, please see [this page](config-dirs.md) for the list of directories Pegagus can access.
