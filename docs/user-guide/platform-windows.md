# Platform notes: Windows

Pegasus is available for Windows 7 and later.

## Multimedia support

Pegasus uses Windows' built-in video playback support. Many video formats are supported out of the box, bux in some cases it might be necessary to install separate codecs, or a codec pack. The *K-Lite Basic* pack is a popular choice that should work well for most cases, you can download it [here](https://www.codecguide.com/download_kl.htm).
