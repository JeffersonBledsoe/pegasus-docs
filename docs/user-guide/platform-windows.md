# Platform notes: Windows

Pegasus is available for **Windows 7 and later**, and should work out of the box.

## Multimedia support

Pegasus uses Windows' built-in video playback support (*DirectShow*). This supports many video formats without problems, bux in some cases it might be necessary to install separate codecs, or a codec pack (a common case for example is Steam videos). The *K-Lite Basic* pack is a popular choice that should work well for most cases, you can download it [here](https://www.codecguide.com/download_kl.htm).
