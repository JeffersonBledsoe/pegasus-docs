# QML tutorial collection

For learning QML, personally I'd recommend reading a few chapters of the guide book (see below), then looking up the relevant types in the official documentation when you firts use them.

## Guide book <small>(easier to follow, more beginner friendly)</small>

You can find it at https://qmlbook.github.io/. The most important parts are:

- [chapter 4](https://qmlbook.github.io/en/ch04/index.html) (basics)
- [chapter 5](https://qmlbook.github.io/en/ch05/index.html) (animations and advanced topics)
- [chapter 6](https://qmlbook.github.io/en/ch06/index.html) (dynamic views)

After that, you can read whatever part you're more interested. You can also download the site as an ebook [here](https://qmlbook.github.io/assets/index.html).

## Official documentation <small>(more detailed)</small>

This one is actually quite good: https://doc.qt.io/archives/qt-4.8/qtquick.html.

You can also find a bunch of documentations here:
