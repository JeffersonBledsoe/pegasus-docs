# Step-by-step: Flixnet theme

In this tutorial, we'll implement the theme above from scratch, inspired by the UI of a certain video streaming company. While the guide is intended to be beginner-friendly, this is a somewhat complex project, so you might want to be familiar with the QML basics and dynamic layout elements (see the [QML tutorials](qml-tutorials.md)).

Let's get started!

- Part 1: [Base layout](example-flixnet-ch1.md)
- Part 2: [Navigation](example-flixnet-ch2.md)
- Part 3: [Using the API](example-flixnet-ch3.md)
- Part 4: [Making things pretty](example-flixnet-ch4.md)
- Part 5: [Game details](example-flixnet-ch5.md)
