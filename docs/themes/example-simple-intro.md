# Step by step: Simple theme

In this tutorial, I'll show the theme creation in practice by implementing the theme above from scratch. Before we start, you might want to be familiar with the QML basics and dynamic layout elements (see the [QML tutorials](qml-tutorials.md)).

The theme has the list of games on the left, in a scrollable menu, with the collection's logo above it. Then some basic information is shown on the right, like title, developer, release year, description, and also a box art.

Let's get started!

- Part 1: [Base layout](example-simple-ch1.md)
- Part 2: [Collections and game list](example-simple-ch2.md)
- Part 3: [Game details](example-simple-ch3.md)
